Raid Shadow Legends has been a popular offer for a while now on GPT Sites. Many people including me have done this offer. This offer pays alot and is one of the best offers you can do currently. I'll be guiding you through this offer. I've done this many times and its extremely easy for me.

## Starting The Offer 

This offer is available on kash.gg and is for PC only. Head over to kash.gg, the offer should show up in the "𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗳𝗳 𝗣𝗶𝗰𝗸𝘀" Section. Click on the offer and after clicking on "𝗣𝗹𝗮𝘆 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗘𝗮𝗿𝗻", you'll be redirected to the download page, the setup file should show up in your downloads folder shortly. Open the "𝗥𝗮𝗶𝗱𝗦𝗲𝘁𝘂𝗽.𝗲𝘅𝗲 𝗙𝗶𝗹𝗲", after that your gonna have to create an account. After creating an account the game should start downloading.

## Playing The Game

At this point the game should be done downloading. After the cutscene sequence is done playing its gonna ask for you to pick a starter champion, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU PICK KAEL, kael is the best starter champion. Using kael you can easily finish the offer. Now your gonna want to finish the tutorial first before you do anything else. After finishing the tutorial head over to the 3 lines on the left side of the screen. Click on promo codes and redeem the code "𝗺𝗼𝗻𝗸𝗲𝘆𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴". 

## Starting The Grind

Alright so Kael and Wukong are gonna be your main champions your gonna be using. Start by completing the missions until you get the 300 gems for completing all 76 of them. Play through the campaign until you reach level 10, a level 10 pack for $14.99 should show up, make sure to buy it. DO NOT OPEN THE 3 VOID SHARDS UNTIL YOU HAVE 5. Collect the purchase bonuses, etc. 

## Opening 5 Void Shards - $33

Getting 5 Void Shards is pretty easy, you wanna 3 Star Normal which will give you 2 Void Shards. At this point you should have 5 in total, including the 3 voids you get from purchasing the pack. Make sure to open all 5 for the offer to track it and pay you.

## Getting 2 Heroes To 5 Stars - $19

Your gonna want to rank up Kael to 5 stars. Get Kael to level 30 and rank him up to rank 4. After ranking him up to rank 4 you wanna max level him and rank him up to rank 5. So you wanna use those 4 star chickens to get Kael to rank 5. You can also use 3 star chickens and 3 star champions to rank him up to rank 4 then you should be able to get him to rank 5 after.
Now your gonna need another 5 star champion, this can be done by simply just ranking up 2 star champion to 3 stars, etc, pretty straight forward, do the same thing you did with Kael.

## Upgrading 1 Champion to 6 stars - $39

This is pretty easy, your basically gonna need 5 star champions to rank Kael to 6 stars. I recommend grinding for champions and upgrading 2 stars and 3 stars to get a bunch of 5 stars. 

## Upgrading 3 Champions to 6 stars - $132

I recommend to farm chapter 12 - stage 3 to level up champions and then rank them up until you get a bunch of 5 stars which can be used to rank up to 6 stars.

> Getting 3 6 Stars should take around 4-5 days. 

Make sure to level up champions by using them on the campaign.

## Kael And Wukong Stats

Below is an 𝗜𝗺𝗮𝗴𝗲 of the stats Kael and Wukong should have.

![kael](/images/kaelstats.jpg)

> ATK, C. RATE, SPD AND ACCURACY ARE MOST IMPORTANT ON BOTH OF THEM.

## 3 Star Normal And Hard

Kael and Wukong should be on your team only while doing this. Putting the pink artifacts on Wukong can help your team stay alive and make it easier to 3 star normal and hard.
Sometimes you can manually play instead of auto if you get stuck even if you have good stats. Kael should also have his skills maxed out.

𝗜 𝗮𝗹𝘀𝗼 𝗿𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗲𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗳𝘂𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗮𝘀𝗰𝗲𝗻𝗱 𝗞𝗮𝗲𝗹 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗲𝘁 𝗪𝘂𝗸𝗼𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗼 𝟯 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿 𝗮𝘀𝗰𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗱.

## The Other Tasks of the offer 

Lvl 25 can be easily achieved by just playing the campaign. 10 Mystery Shards and win 1st Arena battle should be done in the beginning of the game by then. 

## Other Tips

So if you wanna afk, you can use an auto clicker or use "𝗥𝗦𝗟 𝗛𝗲𝗹𝗽𝗲𝗿"

## Conclusion

This offer will not pay instantly, these offers must be manually approved by an admin on the site, which can take a couple hours. If your stuck or have any questions, you can join my discord server.
