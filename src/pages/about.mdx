           I’m a 17 year old interested in computers and coding. My favorite hobbies are playing video games and playing basketball. The Platforms i play on are PC and Playstation. Working out at the gym is also one of my favorite things to do to stay healthy.

           On this site, i’ll be writing blogs on topics. Feel free to read my blogs.
